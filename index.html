	<h2>What?</h2>
	<p>
	Sasquatch makes it incredibly simple to build your own desktop calibre webapps.
	If you've ever looked at Gmail and wondered if you could build something like that...you can and Sasquatch makes it easy.

	<h2>Why?</h2>
	<p>
		There's plenty of other frameworks out in the wild.
		Why do we need another Javascript MVC framework?
		Frameworks like Sproutcore and GWT were built to match development toolsets from the desktop world.
		The browser is not like your native operating system, neither should you browser development toolset.
		It should be built to match the strengths and weakness of the browser.
		Forget about spending time learning a large, complex view hierarchy (SproutCore, I'm looking at you).
		You already know jQuery, right? Of course you do.
		Use jQuery's rich plugin ecosystem &amp; readable HTML templates to create webapps the way you want them to work.

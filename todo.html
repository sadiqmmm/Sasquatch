			<h1>Sample Todo App</h1>
			<section>
				<h3 id="create-project">Create the project</h3>
				<p>
					First thing we want to do is create a new project. we can do this by typing into the console:
				</p>
				<pre>
<code>sasquatch create-project todo</code>
				</pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="file-struct">Project Structure</h3>
				<p>
					Entering into the newly created directory you will see your newly create project with a file structure like this:
				</p>
				<pre>
- todo
  - controller/
  - view/
  - partial/
  - lib/
  - img/
  - style/
  - app.json
  - config.json
  - routes.json
  - template.html
				</pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="template">template.html</h3>
				<p>
					Go ahead and open the template.html file in your favorite text editor. You will see your basic template file with a few for loops that place your css and js files into the webpage. Also some basic html with a body tage that has one div in it with a class content.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you also open the config.json file you can see a simple json file with two keys, "rootElement" and "defaultView", rootElement is the selector for where you want to insert your views into the template file. The second is the defaultView it will use when loading the root of the project. Change this to "todo".
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="create-view">Create a New View/Controller</h3>
				<p>
					Next we would like to create our first view and controller. The can be done by typing the following into the console, in the root of your project.
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code>sasquatch create-view todo</code>
				</pre>
				<p>This creates two files, one in the "view" directory called "todo.erb" and another in the controller directory called "todo.js"</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="todo-view">Your First View</h3>
				<p>
					Go to the view directory and you will see your newly created todo.erb file. You will also see two other files, index.erb and second.erb, you can delete those as they are just sample files.
				</p>
				<p>
					Opening the todo.erb file it will be blank, type some html into the file and save it.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>Next in the root of the project open routes.json. You will see some sample routes already there. 
					<pre>
						<code>
							sasquatch dev server
						</code>
					</pre>
				<p>
					Opening the todo.erb file it will be blank, type some html into the file and save it. Now run this is the root of your project;
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="todo-cont">Your First Controller</h3>
				<p>
					Go ahead and go to the controller directory and open todo.js in you favorite text editor. You will also see two other file, index.js and second.js, you can delete those as they are just sample files.
				</p>

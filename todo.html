			<h1>Sample Todo App</h1>
			<section>
				<h3 id="create-project">Create the project</h3>
				<p>
					First thing we want to do is create a new project. we can do this by typing into the console:
				</p>
<pre>sasquatch create-project todo</pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="file-struct">Project Structure</h3>
				<p>
					Entering into the newly created directory you will see your newly create project with a file structure like this:
				</p>
				<pre>
- todo
  - controller/
  - view/
  - partial/
  - lib/
  - img/
  - style/
  - app.json
  - config.json
  - routes.json
  - template.html</pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="template">template.html</h3>
				<p>
					Go ahead and open the template.html file in your favorite text editor. You will see your basic template file with a few for loops that place your css and js files into the webpage. Also some basic html with a body tage that has one div in it with a class content.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you also open the config.json file you can see a simple json file with two keys, "rootElement" and "defaultView", rootElement is the selector for where you want to insert your views into the template file. The second is the defaultView it will use when loading the root of the project. Change this to "todo".
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="create-view">Create a New View/Controller</h3>
				<p>
					Next we would like to create our first view and controller. The can be done by typing the following into the console, in the root of your project.
				</p>
<pre>sasquatch create-view todo</pre>
				<p>This creates two files, one in the "view" directory called "todo.erb" and another in the controller directory called "todo.js"</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="todo-view">Your First View</h3>
				<p>
					Go to the view directory and you will see your newly created todo.erb file. You will also see two other files, index.erb and second.erb, you can delete those as they are just sample files.
				</p>
				<p>
					Opening the todo.erb file it will be blank, type some html into the file and save it.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>Next in the root of the project open routes.json. You will see some sample routes already there.
<pre>sasquatch dev server</pre>
				<p>
					Opening the todo.erb file it will be blank, type some html into the file and save it. Now run this is the root of your project;
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="todo-cont">Your First Controller</h3>
				<p>
					The "create-view" command also creates a new controller, you can find your new controller in the controller directory. It is the same name as the view, open todo.js in you favorite text editor. You will also see two other files, index.js and second.js, you can delete those as they are just sample files.
				</p>
				<p>
					Controllers have three main function. The first is the loadData, function. This is where you can get all the parameters you
					defined in routes and where you assign local variables that your view can use. loadData has two paramters,
					the first is an object with the named parameters you defined in your routes and the second is a callback
					function where you return an object of local variables used in the corresponding view (todo.erb)
				</p>
				<p>Go ahead and add a key and value to the callback like so:</p>
<pre class="javascript">
exports.loadData = function(data, callback){ //sakljghkljadshgkjldsfhgkldjshfgkjdshgfkljdshgdsfg
  console.log("view ready:todo");
  callback({
    title: "My first todo app"
  });
};
</pre>

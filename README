##View Controller Helper Functions

###$.go(controller, [data])
Function to change hash to new page. Allows you to also send parameters with it

```javascript
$.go('home', {title:"Hey there dolly", id: "SAFDGSDFGDSFG"})
```

###$.goReplace(controller, [data, [isQuiet]])

Same as $.go but replaces current hash with new page.
If isQuiet is set to true then hash will be replaced without dispatching the change signal to change the page

```javascript
//Removes current hash from history and forwards to new hash
$.goReplace('home', {title:"Hey there dolly", id: "SAFDGSDFGDSFG"})

//Removes old hash from history, changes hash, but does not dispatch signal to the hasher to change page
$.goReplace('login', {title:"Hey there dolly", id: "SAFDGSDFGDSFG"}, true)
```
